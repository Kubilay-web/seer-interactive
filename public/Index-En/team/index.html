Tracy's skills include advanced math work, theatrical storytelling, small arms mastery, and refined data analysis practices. < br > <br>Her time on Seer’s Data Strategy team deepened her drive to make big data approachable for everyone through innovative data engineering, dashboard design, and analytical processes that just make sense. She transitioned to the Innovation team in order to continue making big data functional for the masses where she now happily spends her days tinkering with cross-client datasets in BigQuery, building dashboards that celebrate both form and function, and troubleshooting bugs for fun to enable her teammates to tackle bigger and better challenges efficiently. <br><br>Beyond the computer screen, Tracy combines her time at the French Culinary Institute with her five years living in New Orleans to create culinary delights for anyone she can convince to give her a culinary challenge a lá Top Chef. She also has a penchant for venturing beyond the house and seeks out new opportunities for new Michelin star restaurants, strolls along the dog beaches in San Diego, and local trivia competitions.</span>","division":"Innovation","email":"tracym@seerinteractive.com","first_name":"Tracy","hs_child_table_id":0,"hs_created_at":1666098262455,"hs_deleted_at":0,"hs_id":88549070409,"hs_initial_published_at":1727375431009,"hs_is_edited":false,"hs_name":"McDonald, Tracy","hs_path":"tracy-mcdonald","hs_published_at":1727375430930,"hs_updated_at":1727104733160,"hs_updated_by_user_id":25448848,"last_name":"McDonald","linked_in":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracymmcdonald/","photo":{"url":"https://7982212.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7982212/Team%20Member%20Headshots/seer-headshot-avatar-1.png","altText":"","type":"image"},"position":"Lead, Product Development","quote":"\"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.\" - William Butler Yeats","role":{"createdAt":1715974779349,"createdByUserId":0,"id":5,"isHubspotDefined":false,"label":"Lead","labelTranslations":{ },"name":"Lead","order":4,"type":"option","updatedAt":1715974779349,"updatedByUserId":0},"timezone":{"createdAt":1715974779349,"createdByUserId":0,"id":4,"isHubspotDefined":false,"label":"Pacific","labelTranslations":{ },"name":"Pacific","order":3,"type":"option","updatedAt":1715974779349,"updatedByUserId":0},"twitter":"https://twitter.com/McDonaldTracyM","volunteer_link":"https://www.sdhumane.org/","volunteer_logo":{"url":"https://7982212.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7982212/Community%20Partner%20Logos/sd-humane-society-logo.png","altText":"","type":"image"},"volunteer_text":"San Diego Humane Society"},{"bio":"<span data-sheets-value=\"{"1":2,"2":"Bryan is a detail-oriented digital marketer with a knack for creative thinking, strategy, and website migrations.rnrnHe leans on his years of experience having spent his career both in-house and on the client side for a variety of industries like healthcare, finance, and SaaS.rnrnOutside of working hours, you can find him playing with his kids and dog, searching for the best burgers, and training for his next half or full marathon."}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{"2":4482,"4":{"1":2,"2":16576715},"10":2,"11":3,"15":"Poppins"}\">Bryan is a detail-oriented digital marketer with a knack for creative thinking, strategy, and website migrations. <br><br>He leans on his years of experience having spent his career both in-house and on the client side for a variety of industries like healthcare, finance, and SaaS. <br><br>Outside of working hours, you can find him playing with his kids and dog, searching for the best burgers, and training for his next half or full marathon.</span>","division":"SEO","email":"bryan.mckeon@seerinteractive.com","first_name":"Bryan","hs_child_table_id":0,"hs_created_at":1666098262459,"hs_deleted_at":0,"hs_id":88549070410,"hs_initial_published_at":1727375431009,"hs_is_edited":false,"hs_name":"McKeon, Bryan","hs_path":"bryan-mckeon","hs_published_at":1727375430930,"hs_updated_at":1684857845703,"hs_updated_by_user_id":25448848,"instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/b_mckeon/","last_name":"McKeon","linked_in":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanmckeon/","photo":{"url":"https://7982212.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7982212/Team%20Member%20Headshots/bryan-mckeon-seer-headshot.png","altText":"","type":"image"},"position":"Manager, SEO","quote":"\"There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food.\" - Ron Swanson","role":{"createdAt":1715974779349,"createdByUserId":0,"id":3,"isHubspotDefined":false,"label":"Manager","labelTranslations":{ },"name":"Manager","order":2,"type":"option","updatedAt":1715974779349,"updatedByUserId":0},"timezone":{"createdAt":1715974779349,"createdByUserId":0,"id":1,"isHubspotDefined":false,"label":"Eastern","labelTranslations":{ },"name":"Eastern","order":0,"type":"option","updatedAt":1715974779349,"updatedByUserId":0},"volunteer_link":"https://www.goldenrescuenc.org/","volunteer_logo":{"url":"https://7982212.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7982212/Community%20Partner%20Logos/neuse-river-logo.png","altText":"","type":"image"},"volunteer_text":"Neuse River Golden Retriever Rescue"},{"bio":"<span data-sheets-value=\"{"1":2,"2":"Adam started with Seer back in 2008, starting off with ecommerce, education, and B2B SaaS clients.
